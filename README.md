# Voucherify SDK for JavaScript and node.js

### ðŸš§ NOTE: We do not recommend to use this SDK in production just yet ðŸš§

This repository hosts an early version of our brand new SDK that is written in TypeScript and combines support for both JavaScript (client-side) and node.js (server-side). It's still work-in-progress and it is not production-tested yet.
